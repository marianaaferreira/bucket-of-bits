The Bucket of Bits repository is a learning space for embedded systems, IoT, and other related technologies. It contains experimental code, documented projects, and useful insights from my studies in this field.

This repository aims to track the progress of personal projects while serving as a resource for anyone interested in exploring the world of hardware-software integration.

This is a personal learning space, but suggestions and contributions are always welcome! If you have any ideas, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
